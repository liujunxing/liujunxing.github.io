# ABSTRACT 

Prolog-X: portable, incrementally compiled, "ZIP" virtual machine. \
Several novel techniques: the representation of the `recordx` database, the selection of clauses, and the compilation of arithmatic expressions.


# 1. Introduction

ZIP: an abstract Prolog machine. (motivation & key principles refs to: (Clocksin and Mellish, 1981) and (Yokota 1983)).

Design requirements:
* portable 
* compatible ...  (Warren 1979)
* high-performance (for large-scale applications)

These conflicting requirements have led to the design of a system which is a reasonable compromise(折衷,妥协). \
The ZIP machine is the basis of the prolog-x system.

Prolog-X contains a resident compiler which `incrementally` compiles Prolog clauses into bytecodes ...,
 emulated by software ...,  runs at a speed similar to purpose-built Prolog interpreters, ...

Fundamental principles guided design:
* (data & code) compact representations will improve locality, with caches and paging.
* to use low-overhead implementation techniques which "scale up" well for large applications. (?递增编译)

The ZIP machine uses a similar principle of operation as the DECsystem-10 Prolog system of Warren (1977,1980,1983) (继承,参考)

Differences:
* use structure-copying (instead of structure-sharing) for constructing compound-terms  (需深入了解)
* choice-points are created only when required
* globalize var only-if-required at run-time (instead of compile-time)
* detect determinate as early as possible

Removed restrictions (of DEC-10 prolog):
* The user perceives no difference between compiled clauses and interpreted clauses (except for performance).  (?反编译)
* Database references from one clause to another are permitted. 


The ZIP machine is defined by a word format, a set of registers, the format of storage 
areas, an instruction set, and assumptions about the layout of data structures in memory. 
 (几部分: 字格式, 寄存器, 存储区, 指令集, 结构)
In the Prolog-X system, a resident compiler (written in Prolog) incrementally compiles clauses 
 into a compact bytecode sequence.  (递增编译为紧凑的字节码)

The bytecode emulator consists of a number of small routines that define the different operations. 
 (字节码解释由一组小函数执行)
Some instructions can be executed in three different modes, so there is a separate routine for each mode. 
 (有三种不同 mode, ...对应不同的 routine)
The second (and current) version of Prolog-X is a translation of the first version into the C language. (当前版本是 C 语言的)


# 2. Data Words

Every data structure is represented by a (t + v)-bit word which is divided into 
a tag field of t bits in length, and a val field of v bits in length. 
 (数据用一个字分为 tag+value 两部分 bits 表示)
Prolog-X uses a 4-bit tag and 28-bit val.

The 16 primitive tagged objects:
 INT,FLOAT,BOX,ATOM,TERM,CONS,LINK,UNDEF,FUNCTOR,BLOCK,EMPTY,TERMIN,CLAUSE,TABLE,TABREF,PROC.
 (分多种, 主要关注 atom,int,term,ref 几种;  参见 Warren)

To represent a list cell, a CONS-tagged word points to a cell of two words, which correspond to 
the head and tail of a list. 
 (列表的紧凑表示. 另一种是通用 functor,head,tail 表示)
Some of the above tags are not strictly necessary.  (部分 tag 不是必须, 可选其它方式)


# 3. Layout of Data Object Cells

`LINK` pointers are allowed to point directly to words within a cell. 
a functor of arity O is consistently represented as an atom, ... (即 tag=ATOM)
Any unused component of a cell is occupied by a TERMIN word.  (?即 nil)

(以下给出了 atom, functor, proc 等的结构, 相当于 C struct 细节略...)


# 4. Registers

The current state of a computation is contained in a set of registers...  (寄存器列表)
The registers having contents valid at all times are:

* PM   processor mode            (处理模式, ARG,MATCH,COPY)
* XC   current clause pointer
* D    current data pointer
* PC   current program pointer
* L    current (target) local frame
* CL   current (source) local frame
* CP   forward continuation program counter
* CL0  forward continuation local frame
* G    global stack allocated top
* G0   global stack committed top
* H    heap freelist
* BL   backtrack continuation local frame
* BG   backtrack global stack top
* BP   backtrack continuation clause
* TR   trail allocated top
* TR0  trail committed top

Some of the above registers are redundant in that they are caches for slots in the current local frame. (缓存目的)


# 5. Storage Allocation

Storage is allocated in four main areas, (四个主要内存区域)

* Activation records are allocated on the Local stack.  (活动记录)
 Variable slots are not initialised upon activation, because the first use of a variable is identified by the compiler,  (编译器知道变量槽使用时机, 产生对应指令)
* The Global stack, in which most temporary data structures are allocated,  ... 
* Persistent data. structures are allocated in the Heap, as a heap ...    (长期数据在堆上分配, 如 atom,proc,clause 等)
 registers PC, CP, XC, and BP point into it.   (这几个寄存器指向 Heap 区)
* The Trail is an historical record of variable instantiations. ...

In addition, the ZIP machine uses a small scratchpad stack when executing arithmetic instructions, 
 and when executing code between the `functor` and `pop` instructions.  (一个小的辅助栈)

Local stack frames, called activation records, are offset from register CL.
 ... registers CP, CL0, XC, and G0 are saved to or restored from CL. 
An activation record laid out as:
  
```
          (reserved)
  continuation program counter    CP
  continuation local stack frame 
  backtrack clause pointer
  global stack pointer
  backtrack local stack pointer 
  trail pointer 
  current clause pointer 
  (argument and local variables)     数量根据子句不同
  (temporary local variables)
```
The argument slots hold the actual parameters of the procedure call. 
If a variable appears at the top-level in the head of a clause, then its value is simply that of
 the corresponding actual parameter, and there is no need to allocate a variable slot for it. 
 (变量与参数重叠, 不用单独分配, 这样可节省空间)

Locals classified by the compiler as temporaries are allocated nearest the 
 top of the stack, so that the stack space occupied by temporaries can be recovered 
 automatically when the neck of a clause is executed.  (优化: 临时的局部变量分配及...)


# 6. ZIP Instructions  指令集

A complete list of the ZIP instructions is given in the Appendix. 

Processor Modes: `ARG`, `COPY`, or `MATCH`.
Many of the instructions described here have alternative interpretations depending on the current Processor Mode. 
 (很多指令根据 PM 解释/执行不同)
Arguments, if any, follow in the subsequent zero, one, or two bytes.  (指令可能有 0,1,2 个字节的参数)

The instructions described here are generated by an optimising compiler written in Prolog, ...
 (这些指令由 优化编译器 生成...)
The compiler is capable of identifying cases   (编译器识别多种情况)
* where full unification is not required,                   (完整的合一调用)
* where data structures should migrate to other areas,      (? )
* where tail recursion is used,                             (尾递归)
* where unit and doublet clauses require less housekeeping,   (fact & ?桥子句)
* and where certain built-in predicates are translated directly as ZIP instructions (instead of generating calls).  (内建谓词)

Special-purpose instructions are generated in these cases.  (使用优化指令, ref Warren 1977)

The clause `p :- q, r.` compiles into :
```
      <code for p> (其参数子项的所有代码)
      enter n
      <code for q arguments>
      call q
      <code for r arguments>
      call r 
      exit 
```

The `enter` instruction marks the division between the head and body of the clause, and creates a choice point if necessary;
 argument n (of enter instruction) giving the size of the local stack frame. 
Each `call` instruction has argument which refers the required procedure. (可以通过 XR 表查找, 或...)
Finally, `exit` marks the end of the clause, and passes control to the forward continuation. 

Among the optimisations used here are translation of `call exit` sequences 
into a `depart` (or possibly `proceed`) instruction which handles "last call" optimisation.  (ref Warren 1980)


The compilation of terms proceeds as follows:   (项的编译)
* If the term is atomic, it is translated as `constant n`, ...
* If the term is a variable, it is translated as `var n`, where n is an offset from the current stack frame register CL.
* If the term is compound t(a1,...an), translating as:
```
    functor f n 
    code for a1 
    ...
    code for an 
    pop
```
The `functor f n` instruction refers to a functor f/n.  
Code for the n arguments and a housekeeping instruction follow the `functor` instruction. 

The ZIP instruction set listed in the Appendix contains many optimised *variants* of the above instructions,   
 (这些基础指令的优化变体 列于附录; ref: Warren 1977)

Example concatenate(即 append):
    append([], L, L).
    append([X|L1], L2, [X|L3]) :- append(L1,L2,L3).
compile to:
```
    constnil      unify with []   (特化的 functor 指令)
    skipvar       an optimisation of the first variable L
    var 9         ... because this one (L) does the work  (?只需一次工作 -- 这里有疑问)
    return        successfully pass control to continuation, no subgoals

    conslist      unify the list constructor
    firstvar 13   unify the head (first occurrence of variable X)
    firstvar 11   unify the tail (first occurrence of variable L1)
    pop           finished with that term 
    skipvar       optimisation for variable L2 
    lastconslist  unify list constructor, no 'pop' needed
    var 13        head X 
    firtsvar 12   tail: first occurrence of L3 
    argmode       an optimised 'enter' (only 1 subgoal)
    var 11        push first argument L1 
    var 9           L2 
    var 12          L3 
    proceed 1 3    tail-recursive call of 'append'
```
(最后的 proceed 指令执行尾递归优化调用) ... reusing the current stack frame.

The actual operation performed by each instruction depends on the context provided by the PM register.  (实际操作与 mode 有关)
During the execution of the head of a clause, the processor is in `MATCH` mode,    (头部是 match 模式)
 and each instruction attempts to unify its argument with the arguments of the goal.   (合一 指令参数 vs. 目标参数D)
Within the code for a term, data structure construction must be performed, 
 so the processor switches to `COPY` mode so that each instruction can construct its argument by copying. 
  (项的代码: copy 模式, 因需要构造结构)
During the execution of the body of a clause, the processor is in ARG mode, and each instruction passes its argument to 
 the subgoal to be called.  (body 时: arg 模式, 因传参给子目标)

For example, `enter` and its optimised form `argmode` assign mode `ARG` to PM.
 (理解: SWIPL 中 enter 之前用 H 系列指令, 之后用 B 系列指令)
The `functor` instruction pushes the contents of PM on a scratchpad stack and sets PM to `COPY`. 
The matching `pop` instruction restores PM from the scratchpad. 

As an experiment I also implemented a word-coded machine to compare relative performance.  
 (可选用 word 长度的代码, ~5% ... 需测试的数据)
... further reducing the instruction dispatching overhead by means of the so-called "threaded code" technique .  
 (还可使用 threaded-code 技术)


# 7. Selection of Clauses

As mentioned above, clauses are compiled separately and are bidirectionally chained. 
This technique provides easy incremental compilation and modification of the database. 
 (子句单独编译 放入双向链表, 为了增量编译 方便修改db)
However, there are some disadvantages of this technique compared with the alternative (Warren 1983)
 (缺点: 可能执行慢 ...)

In order to compensate for the slower context changing in the ZIP model, we use two techniques to improve clause selection. 
 (补偿/补救方案 ...)
The first technique, which is used in other implementations, is to associate a search key with the first argument of a clause. 
This acts as a. "filter" to reduce the amount of futile(无用的) matching. 
 (1. 使用子句 key 或称索引)
The second technique works as follows. H a. clause has been selected, the system then "looks 
ahead" in the procedure for another clause that might match the goal according 
to the search key. If no further clause matches, then we have discovered that the  
selected clause can be executed deterministically (no choice point is necessary).  
 (2. 使用 look-ahead 方式, 可取消不必要的 choice-point, 确定性执行 )

The techniques gain more purchase on larger programs: we esti
mate that the number of stacked choice points is more than halved when running 
programs such as Chat-80. (效果显著, 可减少一半的 choice-point)


# 8. Arithmetic Instructions  (暂时略)

...

# 9. Discussion of Storage Allocation

## 9.1 Local Stack

... tail-recursive ...
In ... special case, which is detected during compilation, space for the affected variables is migrated to the global stack. 
 (特定情况下, 编译器要决定, 变量需要迁移到 global-stack)
The instructions generated to perform this task are `glofirvar` and `glovar` (see Appendix A).  (引入执行该任务的指令)
Migration may not in fact be necessary, and a run-time check determines this.  (在运行时 检查, 其可能不需要)

## 9.2 Global Stack

If it is necessary to garbage collect the global stack, then a normal mark-sweep-reallocate algorithm can be used. 
 (如果需要, 可使用一般的 mark-sweep-reallocate 算法)
References to data in the global stack are rooted in the local stack variables. 
 (全局 glboal-stack 的数据的根 在 local-stack)
... 更多细节 暂时略 ...  (研究垃圾回收的时候参考)

## 9.3 Heap

Clauses and database entries are stored in the heap using the `assert` and `recordx` predicates, respectively. 
... and full details of the incremental garbage collection method used are discussed by Clocksin (1984). 
 (说明子句的垃圾回收问题, 当子句还在使用中, 其不能被回收. 为此需要一些标志或引用计数计数...)

...

Because clauses are compiled into the database, the time taken to execute a 
record is greater than if clauses were copied as terms into the database. For this 
reason, a small, fast compiler, which does no optimisations, is used for recording 
instead of the usual compiler (used for asserting). 
 (有一个非优化的编译器 用于 record)
Having unoptimised code, which may occupy twice the space of optimised code, is justified by the temporary nature 
of recorded terms.   (非优化的代码可能两倍大, 但对于临时记录 是合理的)
...
This technique is fully described in Clocksin (1984).    (?参见 Clocksin 1984)


# 10. Problems with Storage Management

The strict Prolog execution model permits the use of stack-like memory management, 
 with which storage is reclaimed immediately upon backtracking. 
 (严格的Prolog执行模型允许使用类似栈的内存管理, 在回溯时立即回收的存储空间。)
...

Despite the advantages of stack-like storage management used by Prolog-X, 
 there are two problems with this method.   (但有两个问题...)
First, certain Prolog programming techniques rely on never backtracking, using Prolog goals to simulate perpetual processes 
 which communicate via shared variables.  
 (问题1: 某些程序永不回溯, ...)
The second problem arises from another recent trend, that of mixed-language programming with shared data structures. 
 (问题2: 混合语言编程, 相互调用, 共享数据结构... )
The ZIP machine, on the other hand, is tailored so exclusively ... (为 prolog 专门设计, 用于别的语言不太可能)

# Acknowledgements

The work reported here owes much to preliminary design effort in collaboration 
with Lawrence Byrd, a discussion with David Warren, and to much good advice 
contributed by Richard O'Keefe and Arthur Norman. Transporting the first version 
of Prolog-X to the ICL 2980 under VME was done by Paul Cager, Alan Reiblein, 
and Jim Doores of ICL. Transporting the second version of Prolog-X to the IBM 
3081 was done by Alan Mycroft.
